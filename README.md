<h1 align="center">Weather Application in Java with Client-Server and PostgreSQL</h1>  
<h3 align="center">  
This Java project is a client-server weather application that retrieves and displays current weather conditions and a 3-day forecast. The client sends a location to the server, which queries a **PostgreSQL** database for the relevant weather data. If the exact location is not found, the server returns the closest available match based on latitude and longitude.  

**Features:**  
✔ Client-server architecture for real-time weather retrieval.  
✔ PostgreSQL database for efficient data storage.  
✔ Supports searching by city name with fallback to the nearest available location.  
✔ Admin functionality for updating weather data from a JSON file.  
✔ User-friendly command interface for displaying location and role after connection.
